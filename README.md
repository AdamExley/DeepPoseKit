You have just found DeepPoseKit.
------------
DeepPoseKit is a Python API for pose estimation with deep learning built on [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) and [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). We provide a high-level interface with a GUI for annotating images, a pipeline for data augmentation, and a simple API for initializing, training, and evaluating pose estimation models.

The code for DeepPoseKit is *coming soon*. We are working hard to make it ready for public use. For now [check out our preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/620245v3).
